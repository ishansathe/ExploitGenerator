extcodesize is a special function in Yul Assembly language for Smart Contracts in Ethereum.

This function returns the size of code at a given address.

This size returns to be 0 for Externally Owned Accounts 
and is greater than 0 (value depends on size of contract code) for contract accounts.

However, the size of contract is always 0 before the constructor has finished executing.
It is possible for the contract address to be known before creating the contract.

Hence, it is advised to not verify whether an address is a contract address or an externally owned account address
using the value returned by extcodesize.

(i.e., whether result of extcodesize function on the given address is < 0)
