Delegatecall is a member function of the address type variable.
It allows a calling contract to implement a functionality of the called contract.

The given smart contract was found to have a vulnerability of Untrusted Delegatecall.

Once a contract is delegatecalled, the control over execution is passed to the called contract till its execution finishes.

For the given smart contract, the vulnerable function accepts an address as a parameter.
The address given by the end user is then delegatecalled along with the given arguments.

If the target address is of a malicious contract, then that contract will have complete control over the storage of the calling 
contract.

This is especially dangerous as the called contract may even call a 'selfdestruct' on the storage of the calling contract.
Thus, completely erasing the contract and any potential data within it.
