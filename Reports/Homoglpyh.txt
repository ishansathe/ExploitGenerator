A homoglyph attack occurs when a user confuses a legitimate text with a text that is similar to the original one
Example:

This is a very important text file.         This is a very improtant text file.

Or other examples involving accents.

If the user is required to pass the input to the function (which takes a string as a key to the mapping).
Then the user may make a mistake while entering, resulting in potentially irreversible effects.
