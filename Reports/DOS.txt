Assuming one write to storage within a given loop,
A denial of service attack on a contract function that iterates over an unbounded array will require 1500 iterations minimum for the
transaction to run out of gas.

For a low likelihood,
it is about 5 gas per read from the storage.
Hence, it would then require 600000 iterations. Sending that much input is not nice and is less likely.
There may be some other exploit that is not known, hence kept it here.
