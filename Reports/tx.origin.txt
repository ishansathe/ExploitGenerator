tx.origin keyword is one of the features of Ethereum Blockchain that brings forth the concept of interoperability in smart contracts.

However, this feature has been exploited by wrongdoers.

It is possible for an attacker to create a phishing contract that calls the target contract.

If the target contract has some authentication which verifies whether the origin of the transaction is by the owner (a variable 
set to the address of owner of contract). Then this authentication can be easily bypassed even though the owner had not intended
to call the said contract.

The phishing contract may perform the basic functionality that was intended by the legitimate user. But will have also fooled
the user into calling their own contract and performing some undesired actions.
